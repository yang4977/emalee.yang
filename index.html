        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p> My name is Emalee Yang and my pronouns are She/Her/Hers. I am a senior majoring in Technical Writing and Communications, with an emphasis on the biological and health sciences, and minoring in Public Health. As a Hmong-American womxn, I have been exposed to prejudices within Americaâ€™s healthcare systems. A lack of representation and cultural communication barriers has greatly influenced my passion for strengthening my voice in order to advocate for marginalized communities. I hope to build a bridge of understanding between technical literacies and diverse communities by advocating for and bringing awareness to public health issues. Ultimately, I would like to work with nonprofit organizations in providing medical aid and resources to communities within Minnesota and all around the world. </p>

        <h2>My Growth Journey</h2>
          As an aspiring content creator, I acknowledge my continuous growth in becoming digitally competent. I recognize that my digital literacy stands at a novice level. (You can read more about my digital literacy narrative
          <a href="https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/emaleeyangsdigitalliteracy/home">here</a>).
          This web page will be a testament to my beginning journey as a content creator. As I explore the world of HTML, I am further expanding my digital literacy. I am both excited and overwhelmed with the complexity of HTML, but hope to gain insightful experience within this learning process. Likewise, I find it important to share tools that have helped me during this development process. I have found several resources especially helpful in learning about HTML that I will link below.</p>
